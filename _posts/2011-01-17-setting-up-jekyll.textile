title: Setting up Jekyll
---

I decided I should start blogging again, I commonly come up against things that I feel like I should share my solutions with the world in some way, and blogging seems to be the way most folks do that now a days.

So by copying "git ready":http://gitready.com I am making my own git/jekyll based blog.
